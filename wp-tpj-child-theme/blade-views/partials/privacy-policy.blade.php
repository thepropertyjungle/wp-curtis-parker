This balancing is performed as objectively as possible by our Data Protection Lead.

<h2>What happens if I refuse to give <span class="text-uppercase">{{ $global_options['gdpr_options']['registrationCompanyName'] ?? 'COMPANY NAME NEEDED' }}</span> my personal data?</h2>

<p>The information about you that we have collected for the performance of our contracts is required in order for us to successfully fulfil our obligations to you. If you choose not to provide the personal data requested, we will not be able to enter into a contract with you to provide the benefits we offer. If we are already processing your personal information under a contract, you must end our contractual relationship (as/where permitted) in order to exercise some of your rights.</p>

<p>We process some personal information as part of a contractual relationship with a Data Controller. Any requests to restrict this type of processing should be forwarded to the Data Controller; they will be responsible for discussing your concerns and making any decisions.</p>

<h2>What are <span class="text-uppercase">{{ $global_options['gdpr_options']['registrationCompanyName'] ?? 'COMPANY NAME NEEDED' }}</span>'s 'legitimate interests'?</h2>

<p>Legitimate interests are a flexible basis upon which the law permits the processing of an individual's personal data. To determine whether we have a legitimate interest in processing your data, we balance the needs and benefits to us against the risks and benefits for you of us processing your data. This balancing is performed as objectively as possible by our Data Protection Lead. You are able to object to our processing and we shall consider the extent to which this affects whether we have a legitimate interest.

<h2>What profiling or automated decision making do we perform?</h2>

<p><strong class="text-uppercase">{{ $global_options['gdpr_options']['registrationCompanyName'] ?? 'COMPANY NAME NEEDED' }}</strong> does not perform any profiling or automated decision making based on your personal data.</p>

<h2>How long will your personal data be kept?</h2>

<p><strong class="text-uppercase">{{ $global_options['gdpr_options']['registrationCompanyName'] ?? 'COMPANY NAME NEEDED' }}</strong> holds different categories of personal data for different periods of time. Wherever possible, we will endeavour to minimise the amount of personal data that we hold and the length of time for which it is held.</p>

<ul>
    <li>If 'consent' is the basis for our lawful processing of your data, we will retain your data so long as both the purpose for which it was collected, and your consent, are still valid. We review the status of your consent every twelve (12) months and treat non-response to our requests for renewal of consent as if they were your request to withdraw consent. Occasionally, we might identify a legitimate interest in retaining some of your personal data that has been obtained by consent. If we do, we will inform you that we intend to retain it under these conditions and identify the interest specifically.</li>
    <li>Identity, Contact and Transaction Data are held indefinitely (subject to object by the individual, or individual's having left our client's business) in order to provide a superior service to returning customers.</li>
    <li>If we process your data on the basis of 'legitimate interests', we will retain your data for so long as the purpose for which it is processed remains active. We review the status of our legitimate interests every twelve (12) months and will update this notice whenever we determine that either a legitimate interest no longer exists or that a new one has been found.</li>
    <li>All categories of personal data that are held by us because they are essential for the performance of a contract, will be held for a period of six years, as determined by reference to the Limitations Act 1980, for the purposes of exercising or defending legal claims.</li>
